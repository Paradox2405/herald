# Introduction

Squire provides reliable Bluetooth communication and range finding across a wide range of mobile devices, allowing
Contact Tracing and other applications to have regular and accurate information to make them highly effective.

|Wide Phone Support|Easy to integrate|Flexible|
|---|---|---|
|95% of phones worldwide can use the Squire Protocol|Provide a few callbacks to the Squire API and integrate Squire to your app in minutes using your own payload|Does not restrict how people can use it, for contact tracing or any reliable Bluetooth communication|

Squire provides a solution to the following epidemiological problems:-

## Features

|<b>Detect nearby phones</b>|100% detection of phones in the foreground and background across iOS and Android devices. Squire supports the 35% (in the UK) of Android phones that cannot act as  advertisers' and so remain unseen by advertising-only based protocols.|
|<b>Provide regular distance readings</b>|Squire performs distance estimations every few seconds, with higher frequency on modern phones. This allows for a more accurate data and risk picture over time. Maximum frequency can be configured to optimise battery use. At ~4s per reading battery use is 6-11% over 8 hours, depending on the age of the phone and its battery capacity.|
|<b>Interoperate internationally</b>|By providing a common packet header we allow for international interoperability amongst all contact tracing applications, whether designed for centralised or decentralised contact matching and risk scoring.|

## Thanks

A lot of work has gone in to mobile app based contact tracing protocol 
research, design, testing and collaboration worldwide. We'd like to thank 
all of those in VMware Pivotal Labs and elsewhere worldwide that have 
assisted with various national and state governments to use mobile contact 
tracing to help save lives. ❤️
